        <h1>System & Network Architecture</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our in-depth exploration of modern system and network architectures! In today’s interconnected world, efficient system design and robust network infrastructure are fundamental to ensuring high performance, security, and scalability.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Systems and Networks</h2>
        <p>Systems are the backbone of any computational environment, encompassing both hardware and software components. Networks interlink these systems, allowing for seamless data exchange and resource sharing. From local networks (LAN) to complex global infrastructures, a strong foundation in system and network principles is essential for any IT professional.</p>

        <h2>Core Topics in System Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> The OS manages resources, facilitates processes, and handles file storage, laying the foundation for all software applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtualization:</strong> Enabling multiple operating systems and applications to run on the same hardware, maximizing resources and flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Protocols:</strong> Protecting systems from unauthorized access and ensuring data integrity across networks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Network Essentials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Addressing and Subnetting:</strong> Key to organizing and managing network traffic effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Routing & Switching:</strong> Directs data to its destination, whether within a small network or across the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Protocols and best practices for safeguarding data across the network from threats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recent Trends in System and Network Technologies</h2>
        <p>Emerging technologies like SDN (Software-Defined Networking) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) are reshaping the landscape by enabling more dynamic, flexible, and scalable network environments. Additionally, advances in cybersecurity and cloud-native infrastructures continue to drive the evolution of both systems and networks.</p>
